% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Strong lensed AGN has been considered as a unique tool to exam the correlations between the mass of the supermassive Black Hole and its host galaxies. In this work, we have adopted eight strongly lensed system from the H0LiCOW collaboration. The deep \hst\ data and adopt the \lenstronomy\ to reconstruct the image of the source. The \mbh\ are estimated using the board emission line. We compare our inference to the once in the literature and find a consistent result. Combining them together, we are able to constrain the $\gamma$ to xxx. Our our demonstrate is demonstrate the power of using strong lensed AGNs. The sample of the data are supposed to increase rapidly.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
Structure:

[] What is scaling relations.

[] Strong lensing provide a tool to study to higher redshift.

[] Previous work. H0LiCOW XI. H0LiCOW XII. In these two works, the host galaxy is first reconstructed using the pixellation. Then, the host image are inferred in the source plan by fitting as a Sersic model. This means, the two-step inference of the host information. 

[] In this work, we adopt an independent tool and carry out a direct inference of the host properties. 

[]This paper is organized as follows. Zeropoint are defined in the AB systems.

\section{Sample Selection}
We adopt the eight lens systems from our H0LiCOW collaboration including HE~0435$-$1223, RXJ~1131$-$1231, WFI~2033$-$4723, HE~1104$-$1805, SDSS~1206$+$4332, SDSS~0246$-$0825, HE~0047$-$1756 and HS~2209$+$1914. For conciseness, we abbreviate each lens name to four digits (e.g., RXJ~1131$-$1231 to RXJ1131). In \citet{Ding2017a}, the simulation exercise has been performed to understand the fidelity of the source reconstruction based on these eight systems and verified that the host inference is trustworthy when its magnitude are brighter than 20 magnitude, 2$-$4 magnitudes dimmer than the AGN. The detailed information of the observations for these eight systems are given in Table~1 therein~\ding{Maybe we can re-summarized it again here}. We analyzed the HST imaging data of the sample and the observation has been introduced by~\citet{Ding2017a}. Moreover, three quadruply-imaged AGNs (HE0435, RXJ1131 and WFI2033) have HST imaging data at multi-bands from which we could infer the color of the host galaxy and obtain more accurate stellar template. 

%[]The comparison sample (32 QSO paper)
To exam the evolution of the lensed system, we aim to compare.... expend the sample size and the data resolution, we adopt the recent efforts by~\citet{Ding2020}, including 32 QSO at redshift range $1.2<z<1.9$, with the local sample.

\section{Surface photometry}
We describe the reconstruction of the lensed host galaxy in this section. For part of the lensed systems, the lens models have been derived with host galaxies reconstructed ref[]. Aiming at the time-delay cosmography, these works focused on deriving the precise and accurate lens models, while the reconstructed the host galaxy is only a by-product. Thus, in this work, we apply our own approach to infer the photometry of the host galaxy in the source plane. As will show, we compare our inference to the previous ones for cross check purpose. 

%We then obtain the color of the host to derive the rest-frame R band magnitude and estimate the stellar mass.

\subsection{Lens model inference and host reconstruction}
We simultaneously carry out the fitting process to derive the lens model, subtract the central AGN light and reconstruct the host galaxy in the source plan. We follow the common practice and assume the photometry of the galaxies (including the lensing galaxy and source galaxy) follows the 2-D elliptical \sersic\ profile, which defines the host flux as consistent to the comparison sample. The bright AGNs are unsolved and described by a scaled PSF. We adopt the elliptical power-law models to describe the surface mass density of the deflector.

%The one of the fitting setting 
[] We adopt the \lenstronomy~ref[] to perform the modeling task. We draw the mask to define the fitting region. The nearby object are considered as extended source and fitted as \sersic. 

%Different settings to do the rank.
[] We cut out the available PSFs in the files. Two approaches including QSO mask and PSF reconstruction. Subgrid with 2 and 3 are selected to describe the Sersic profile.  The detail of the fitting settings: gamma as 1.9, 2.0, 2.1.

%How to do the rank.
[] Top rank result combined to get the inference of the host galaxies and the way of weighting flux to get magnitude.

We present the fitting for the eight systems in the following sub-sections.

\subsubsection{HE0435}
The results of HE0435. A table to summarize the fitting results. The inference of the observed magnitude, Reff and sersic.

\subsection{Stellar mass estimates}
For those ones have multi-bands, we attempt to infer the color of the host in the image plane.

How do we infer the color? All the available bands? Which is dominating the scatter?

\section{Black Hole mass estimates}
We use viral method to estimate the mass of the black hole. The board-line adopted. We aim to adopt the self-consistent to recalibrate the \mbh~of our sample. 
[] The recipes. [] The board lines and the resulting BH mass and listed in the table. []The summarizing table.

\section{Results}

\ding{Do we consider the Selection effect? We only select 8 sample? Maybe we only over plot them together and see if the results are self-consistent?}

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
[] This work confirm the bright future of lensing.
